#### I am a passionate individual with a strong educational background in Computer Science. I completed my Associate's degree in Computer Science from City College of San Francisco and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at San Francisco State University (SFSU).My primary focus lies in Android/iOS and web app development. I have a keen interest in creating innovative and user-friendly applications in these domains. Additionally, I am fascinated by the potential applications of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field. During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work with various AI tools and technologies, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in AI fundamentals and deep learning techniques. Moreover, I hold a certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning for Biotechnology (gstar), which further enhances my expertise in applying AI to the field of biotechnology.

I'm constantly looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and always eager to learn more!
